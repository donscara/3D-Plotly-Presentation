## Slide with Bullets

We have created a web page presentation using R Markdown that features a plot created with Plotly. 

We used the mtcars dataset.

## MTCARS Dataset Summary

```{r cars, echo = TRUE}
summary(mtcars)
```

## Plot

```{r echo=TRUE}
library(plotly)
library(ggplot2)
data("mtcars")
p<-plot_ly(x=mtcars$mpg, y=mtcars$cyl,z=mtcars$disp, type = "scatter3d", mode="markers",color = mtcars$cyl)
p
```
